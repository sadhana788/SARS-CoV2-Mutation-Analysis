# SARS-CoV2-Mutation-Analysis
This project is a small-scale bioinformatics analysis to identify and visualize common mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence. It showcase a complete data analysis pipeline using various Python libraries.

## Project Description
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, starting from raw genetic data and culminating in a clear visualization of key findings. The primary goal was to process a set of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, identify mutations by comparing them to a standard reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-1), and determine the most common mutations present in the dataset.

## Technologies Used
-   **Python:** The core programming language for the entire analysis.
-   **Jupyter Notebook:** The primary environment for coding, testing, and documentation.
-   **SQL (SQLite):** Used to create and manage a local database for structured data storage.
-   **Pandas & Biopython:** Libraries essential for data manipulation, sequence handling, and    database interaction.
-   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used to create the final data visualization.

## Key Findings
Based on the analysis of the dataset, the following were identified as the most common mutations:
* **G7C:** 11 times
* **T9C:** 11 times
* **T11C:** 11 times
* **T3G:** 10 times
* **T2G:** 10 times
* **A14C:** 8 times
* **G8A:** 8 times
* **A5C:** 7 times
* **T13C:** 7 times
* **T18C:** 6 times

This analysis provides insight into the most frequent genetic changes within the sample set, indicating potential areas of high mutation rates in the virus.
